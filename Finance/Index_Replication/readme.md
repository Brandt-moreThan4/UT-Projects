# An attempt to replicate the S&P 500 Index from 2010/12/31-2020/12/31

*Link to code:* [Notebook](https://github.com/Brandt-moreThan4/UT-Projects/blob/master/Finance/Index_Replication/hw1_SP_500-final.ipynb) 

### Assumptions:
* No market frictions (i.e. transaction costs,spreads) 
* Rebalanced quarterly 
* Reconstituted annually.

S&P  Replication Results:

S&P was replicated by using the top 250 companies, by market cap at each quarter, and dividends are reinvested on the day received into the 10 largest companies that day. Weighting our portfolio more heavily to the largest stocks in a period when large stocks outperformed is likely what contributed to our outperformance over the period. In addition to our assumption of no transaction cost.
