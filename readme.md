# School Projects

For a look at the curriculumn see: [MSBA course curriculumn](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Master-of-Science-in-Business-Analytics/Academics/Curriculum).

*Note: I'm still working on providing appropriate descriptions for all of the projects displayed, but for the most part, if a project link does not have a readme associated with it, then the notebook file likely has sufficient enough explanations within to understand the project.*
